## About Me
Hi, I'm Matthew, a programmer and finance student from the North East of England. I have recently graduated from Durham University (where I studied computer science) and am currently studying for my master's degree in finance at Newcastle University!

During my time as an undergraduate, I have found a passion for machine learning and the greater field of data science. I am also very interested in financial markets and am looking to find opportunities to further explore these two fields and combine them.

I am in the process of applying for graduate roles, looking particularly for roles in machine learning, software development or data analysis, ideally within the FinTech industries.
